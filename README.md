## Overview
We aim to develop a comprehensive chess teaching program that plays games with users via a robotic arm, provides personalized feedback, recognizes areas of improvement, and dynamically adapts future games to maximize learning opportunities.

## Timeline
Winter Semester '23: 
    - Computer Vision: Make the arm capable of accurately identifying user moves
    - AI: Configure an AI that will make moves
    - Arm Movement: Code basic movement methods into the arms and 3D print parts to ensure the robot can manipulate pieces
    - User Interface: Create a UI so users can start/stop/draw games
Fall Semester '23: 
    - Teaching AI: Train an AI capable of teaching chess
